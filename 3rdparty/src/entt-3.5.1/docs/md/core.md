# Introduction

`EnTT` comes with a bunch of core functionalities mostly used by the other parts
of the library itself.<br/>
Hardly users will include these features in their code, but it's worth
describing what `EnTT` offers so as not to reinvent the wheel in case of need.

# Unique sequential identifiers

Sometimes it's useful to be able to give unique, sequential numeric identifiers
to types either at compile-time or runtime.<br/>
There are plenty of different solutions for this out there and I could have used
one of them. However, I decided to spend my time to define a couple of tools
that fully embraces what the modern C++ has to offer.

## Compile-time generator

To generate sequential numeric identifiers at compile-time, `EnTT` offers the
`identifier` class template:

```cpp
// defines the identifiers for the given types
using id = entt::identifier<a_type, another_type>;

// ...

switch(a_type_identifier) {
case id::type<a_type>:
    // ...
    break;
case id::type<another_type>:
    // ...
    break;
default:
    // ...
}
```

This is all what this class template has to offer: a `type` inline variable that
contains a numeric identifier for the given type. It can be used in any context
where constant expressions are required.

As long as the list remains unchanged, identifiers are also guaranteed to be
stable across different runs. In case they have been used in a production
environment and a type has to be removed, one can just use a placeholder to left
the other identifiers unchanged:

```cpp
template<typename> struct ignore_type {};

using id = entt::identifier<
    a_type_still_valid,
    ignore_type<a_type_no_longer_valid>,
    another_type_still_valid
>;
```

Perhaps a bit ugly to see in a codebase but it gets the job done at least.

## Runtime generator

To generate sequential numeric identifiers at runtime, `EnTT` offers the
`family` class template:

```cpp
// defines a custom generator
using id = entt::family<struct my_tag>;

// ...

const auto a_type_id = id::type<a_type>;
const auto another_type_id = id::type<another_type>;
```

This is all what a _family_ has to offer: a `type` inline variable that contains
a numeric identifier for the given type.<br/>
The generator is customizable, so as to get different _sequences_ for different
purposes if needed.

Please, note that identifiers aren't guaranteed to be stable across different
runs. Indeed it mostly depends on the flow of execution.

# Hashed strings

A hashed string is a zero overhead unique identifier. Users can use
human-readable identifiers in the codebase while using their numeric
counterparts at runtime, thus without affecting performance.<br/>
The class has an implicit `constexpr` constructor that chews a bunch of
characters. Once created, all what one can do with it is getting back the
original string or converting it into a number.<br/>
The good part is that a hashed string can be used wherever a constant expression
is required and no _string-to-number_ conversion will take place at runtime if
used carefully.

Example of use:

```cpp
auto load(entt::hashed_string::hash_type resource) {
    // uses the numeric representation of the resource to load and return it
}

auto resource = load(entt::hashed_string{"gui/background"});
```

There is also a _user defined literal_ dedicated to hashed strings to make them
more user-friendly:

```cpp
constexpr auto str = "text"_hs;
```

## Wide characters

The hashed string has a design that is close to that of an `std::basic_string`.
It means that `hashed_string` is nothing more than an alias for
`basic_hashed_string<char>`. For those who want to use the C++ type for wide
character representation, there exists also the alias `hashed_wstring` for
`basic_hashed_string<wchar_t>`.<br/>
In this case, the user defined literal to use to create hashed strings on the
fly is `_hws`:

```cpp
constexpr auto str = "text"_hws;
```

Note that the hash type of the `hashed_wstring` is the same of its counterpart.

## Conflicts

The hashed string class uses internally FNV-1a to compute the numeric
counterpart of a string. Because of the _pigeonhole principle_, conflicts are
possible. This is a fact.<br/>
There is no silver bullet to solve the problem of conflicts when dealing with
hashing functions. In this case, the best solution seemed to be to give up.
That's all.<br/>
After all, human-readable unique identifiers aren't something strictly defined
and over which users have not the control. Choosing a slightly different
identifier is probably the best solution to make the conflict disappear in this
case.

# Monostate

The monostate pattern is often presented as an alternative to a singleton based
configuration system. This is exactly its purpose in `EnTT`. Moreover, this
implementation is thread safe by design (hopefully).<br/>
Keys are represented by hashed strings, values are basic types like `int`s or
`bool`s. Values of different types can be associated to each key, even more than
one at a time. Because of this, users must pay attention to use the same type
both during an assignment and when they try to read back their data. Otherwise,
they will probably incur in unexpected results.

Example of use:

```cpp
entt::monostate<entt::hashed_string{"mykey"}>{} = true;
entt::monostate<"mykey"_hs>{} = 42;

// ...

const bool b = entt::monostate<"mykey"_hs>{};
const int i = entt::monostate<entt::hashed_string{"mykey"}>{};
```

# Type support

`EnTT` provides some basic information about types of all kinds.<br/>
It also offers additional features that are not yet available in the standard
library or that will never be.

## Type info

This class template isn't a drop-in replacement for `std::type_info` but can
provide similar information which are not implementation defined and don't
require to enable RTTI.<br/>
Therefore, they can sometimes be even more reliable than those obtained
otherwise.

Currently, there are a couple of information available:

* The numeric identifier associated with a given type:

  ```cpp
  auto id = entt::type_info<my_type>::id();
  ```

  In general, the `id` function is also `constexpr` but this isn't guaranteed
  for all compilers and platforms (although it's valid with the most well-known
  and popular ones).

  This function **can** use non-standard features of the language for its own
  purposes. This makes it possible to provide compile-time identifiers that
  remain stable across different runs.<br/>
  In all cases, users can prevent the library from using these features by means
  of the `ENTT_STANDARD_CPP` definition. In this case, there is no guarantee
  that identifiers remain stable across executions. Moreover, they are generated
  at runtime and are no longer a compile-time thing.

* The _name_ associated with a given type:

  ```cpp
  auto name = entt::type_info<my_type>::name();
  ```

  The name associated with a type is extracted from some information generally
  made available by the compiler in use. Therefore, it may differ depending on
  the compiler and may be empty in the event that this information isn't
  available.<br/>
  For example, given the following class:

  ```cpp
  struct my_type { /* ... */ };
  ```

  The name is `my_type` when compiled with GCC or CLang and `struct my_type`
  when MSVC is in use.<br/>
  Most of the time the name is also retrieved at compile-time and is therefore
  always returned through an `std::string_view`. Users can easily access it and
  modify it as needed, for example by removing the word `struct` to standardize
  the result. `EnTT` won't do this for obvious reasons, since it requires
  copying and creating a new string potentially at runtime.

  This function **can** use non-standard features of the language for its own
  purposes. As for the numeric identifier, users can prevent the library from
  using non-standard features by means of the `ENTT_STANDARD_CPP` definition. In
  this case, the name will be empty by default.

An external type system can also be used if needed. In fact, `type_info` can be
specialized by type and is also _sfinae-friendly_ in order to allow more refined
specializations such as:

```cpp
template<typename Type>
struct entt::type_info<Type, std::enable_if_t<has_custom_data_v<Type>>> {
    static constexpr entt::id_type id() ENTT_NOEXCEPT {
        return Type::custom_id();
    }

    static constexpr std::string_view name() ENTT_NOEXCEPT {
        return Type::custom_name();
    }
};
```

Note that this class template and its specializations are widely used within
`EnTT`. It also plays a very important role in making `EnTT` work transparently
across boundaries in many cases.<br/>
Please refer to the dedicated section for more details.

### Almost unique identifiers

Since the default non-standard, compile-time implementation makes use of hashed
strings, it may happen that two types are assigned the same numeric
identifier.<br/>
In fact, although this is quite rare, it's not entirely excluded.

Another case where two types are assigned the same identifier is when classes
from different contexts (for example two or more libraries loaded at runtime)
have the same fully qualified name.<br/>
If the types have the same name and belong to the same namespace then their
identifiers _could_ be identical (they won't necessarily be the same though).

Fortunately, there are several easy ways to deal with this:

* The most trivial one is to define the `ENTT_STANDARD_CPP` macro. Runtime
  identifiers don't suffer from the same problem in fact. However, this solution
  doesn't work well with a plugin system, where the libraries aren't linked.

* Another possibility is to specialize the `type_info` class for one of the
  conflicting types, in order to assign it a custom identifier. This is probably
  the easiest solution that also preserves the feature of the tool.

* A fully customized identifier generation policy (based for example on enum
  classes or preprocessing steps) may represent yet another option.

These are just some examples of possible approaches to the problem but there are
many others. As already mentioned above, since users have full control over
their types, this problem is in any case easy to solve and should not worry too
much.<br/>
In all likelihood, it will never happen to run into a conflict anyway.

## Type index

Types in `EnTT` are assigned also unique, sequential _indexes_ generated at
runtime:

```cpp
auto index = entt::type_index<my_type>::value();
```

This value may differ from the numeric identifier of a type and isn't guaranteed
to be stable across different runs. However, it can be very useful as index in
associative and unordered associative containers or for positional accesses in a
vector or an array.

So as not to conflict with the other tools available, the `family` class isn't
used to generate these indexes. Therefore, the numeric identifiers returned by
the two tools may differ.<br/>
On the other hand, this leaves users with full powers over the `family` class
and therefore the generation of custom runtime sequences of indices for their
own purposes, if necessary.

An external generator can also be used if needed. In fact, `type_index` can be
specialized by type and is also _sfinae-friendly_ in order to allow more refined
specializations such as:

```cpp
template<typename Type>
struct entt::type_index<Type, std::void_d<decltype(Type::index())>> {
    static entt::id_type value() ENTT_NOEXCEPT {
        return Type::index();
    }
};
```

Note that indexes **must** still be generated sequentially in this case.<br/>
The tool is widely used within `EnTT`. Generating indices not sequentially would
break an assumption and would likely lead to undesired behaviors.

## Type traits

A handful of utilities and traits not present in the standard template library
but which can be useful in everyday life.<br/>
This list **is not** exhaustive and contains only some of the most useful
classes. Refer to the inline documentation for more information on the features
offered by this module.

### Member class type

The `auto` template parameter introduced with C++17 made it possible to simplify
many class templates and template functions but also made the class type opaque
when members are passed as template arguments.<br/>
The purpose of this utility is to extract the class type in a few lines of code:

```cpp
template<typename Member>
using clazz = entt::member_class_t<Member>;
```

### Integral constant

Since `std::integral_constant` may be annoying because of its form that requires
to specify both a type and a value of that type, there is a more user-friendly
shortcut for the creation of integral constants.<br/>
This shortcut is the alias template `entt::integral_constant`:

```cpp
constexpr auto constant = entt::integral_constant<42>;
```

Among the other uses, when combined with a hashed string it helps to define tags
as human-readable _names_ where actual types would be required otherwise:

```cpp
constexpr auto enemy_tag = entt::integral_constant<"enemy"_hs>;
registry.emplace<enemy_tag>(entity);
```

### Tag

Since `id_type` is very important and widely used in `EnTT`, there is a more
user-friendly shortcut for the creation of integral constants based on it.<br/>
This shortcut is the alias template `entt::tag`.

If used in combination with hashed strings, it helps to use human-readable names
where types would be required otherwise. As an example:

```cpp
registry.emplace<entt::tag<"enemy"_hs>>(entity);
```

However, this isn't the only permitted use. Literally any value convertible to
`id_type` is a good candidate, such as the named constants of an unscoped enum.

# Utilities

It's not possible to escape the temptation to add utilities of some kind to a
library. In fact, `EnTT` also provides a handful of tools to simplify the
life of developers:

* `entt::identity`: the identity function object that will be available with
  C++20. It returns its argument unchanged and nothing more. It's useful as a
  sort of _do nothing_ function in template programming.

* `entt::overload`: a tool to disambiguate different overloads from their
  function type. It works with both free and member functions.<br/>
  Consider the following definition:

  ```cpp
  struct clazz {
      void bar(int) {}
      void bar() {}
  };
  ```

  This utility can be used to get the _right_ overload as:

  ```cpp
  auto *member = entt::overload<void(int)>(&clazz::bar);
  ```

  The line above is literally equivalent to:

  ```cpp
  auto *member = static_cast<void(clazz:: *)(int)>(&clazz::bar);
  ```

  Just easier to read and shorter to type.

* `entt::overloaded`: a small class template used to create a new type with an
  overloaded `operator()` from a bunch of lambdas or functors.<br/>
  As an example:

  ```cpp
  entt::overloaded func{
      [](int value) { /* ... */ },
      [](char value) { /* ... */ }
  };

  func(42);
  func('c');
  ```

  Rather useful when doing metaprogramming and having to pass to a function a
  callable object that supports multiple types at once.

* `entt::y_combinator`: this is a C++ implementation of **the** _y-combinator_.
  If it's not clear what it is, there is probably no need for this utility.<br/>
  Below is a small example to show its use:

  ```cpp
  entt::y_combinator gauss([](const auto &self, auto value) -> unsigned int {
      return value ? (value + self(value-1u)) : 0;
  });

  const auto result = gauss(3u);
  ```

  Maybe convoluted at a first glance but certainly effective. Unfortunately,
  the language doesn't make it possible to do much better.

This is a rundown of the (actually few) utilities made available by `EnTT`. The
list will probably grow over time but the size of each will remain rather small,
as has been the case so far.
